VxWireguard-Generator
=====================

Utility to generate VXLAN over Wireguard mesh SD-WAN configuration

## Setup

Requires: Linux, Python >= 3.6, [toml](https://pypi.org/project/toml/), [PyNaCl](https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/)

```bash
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py build
sudo python3 setup.py install --force
```

## Example

```bash
# Find a good place to store the data
mkdir -p ~/Documents/vwnetworks
cd ~/Documents/vwnetworks

# Add a mesh network
vwgen add wg-meshvpn

# Set the address pool of the network
vwgen set wg-meshvpn pool-ipv4 172.20.10.0/24 pool-ipv6 2001:db8:42::/64

# Add 3 nodes
# They will have IPv4 addresses fixed and IPv6 addresses dynamically calculated on demand
vwgen add wg-meshvpn node1 node2 node3

# Set endpoint of node1 and node2, leave empty for node3 so it will do auto-discovery
vwgen set wg-meshvpn node node1 endpoint '[2001:db8:1::1]:1234' listen-port 1234
vwgen set wg-meshvpn node node2 endpoint '[2001:db8:2::1]:2345' listen-port 2345
vwgen set wg-meshvpn node node3 listen-port 3456

# Show all information we have so far
vwgen show wg-meshvpn

# Generate a configuration for node1
# It's a bad habit to log into server with root, this is just a demo
vwgen showconf wg-meshvpn node1 > node1.conf
scp node1.conf 'root@[2001:db8:1::1]:/etc/wireguard/wg-meshvpn.conf'
ssh root@2001:db8:1::1 chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg-meshvpn.conf \; wg-quick up wg-meshvpn

# Generate a configuration for node2
# This time we will use systemd to launch wg-quick
vwgen showconf wg-meshvpn node2 > node2.conf
scp node1.conf 'root@[2001:db8:2::1]:/etc/wireguard/wg-meshvpn.conf'
ssh root@2001:db8:2::1 chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg-meshvpn.conf \; systemctl start wg-quick@wg-meshvpn

# The configuration is stored in plaintext TOML format
less wg-meshvpn.conf
```

## Routing protocol

Now you have all your nodes on the save virtual Ethernet.

You may run routing protocol designed for mesh networks (e.g.
[Babel](https://github.com/jech/babeld), EIGRP) on interface `vwg-meshvpn` to
announce connected network segments to each other, and to calculate the best
forwarding route between each node.

## Limitations

- The MAC and IPv6 addresses is generated with the last bits from the public key. Currently no duplication detection is performed. It is recommended that you check the addresses yourself, or use DAD to detect duplicates. If a collision is found, please regenerate a new key, or packets will be forwarded to the wrong node.

- The mesh network relies on the fact that every node is in a trusted environment that no one can inject IPv6 ND packets into the backbone network. In other words, do not bridge the backbone network to your customer network. Use routing instead of bridging.
